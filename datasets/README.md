# Datasets generation for FLamingo

This folder contains scripts and configurations for generating datasets for FLamingo.

The scripts would be deprecated in the future. We recommend using ![FLamingo-datasets](https://github.com/isaacveg/FLamingo-datasets) for generating datasets for FLamingo.

## Basic ideas
The basic idea of the dataset generation is to create a dataset that can be used for federated learning.
The dataset is generated by splitting a base dataset into multiple clients, each with its own data distribution.

The data are contained in `{rank}.npz` files under `TARGET_DIR/train/` and `TARGET_DIR/test/`.
Specifically, `0.npz` normally contains the full training or test dataset, while `1.npz` to `N.npz` contain the data for each client.

## How to use
1. Check whether your target dataset can be generated using the scripts in this folder.
2. Use the corresponding script to generate the dataset. For specific instructions, refer to the corresponding script.

## LEAF
The LEAF dataset is a benchmark for federated learning. It contains several datasets such as Shakespeare and FEMNIST.
